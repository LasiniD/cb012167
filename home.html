            <p>There are 250 species of turtles on the planet today. Sea turtles, which are seven of these, are marine life. The remaining 243 species are terrestrial or dwell in freshwater marshes and ponds. Tortoises are the name for turtles that only live on land, or terrestrial turtles.</p><br>
            <p>The coastlines of Sri Lanka are visited by five of the world's seven species of sea turtles during the breeding season. They are the Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea).</p> <br>
            <p>With such a huge variety of species, there are virtually endless fascinating facts about turtles. Some species have traits unique to them in particular, and some adaptations are held by all turtle species. Some unique traits are,

            <p>Turtles have adapted to a variety of environments, but the majority occur in southeastern North America and South Asia. Most species are aquatic, with some terrestrial and others divided between land and water. Each species has a preferred habitat and is rarely found elsewhere. For example, the gopher tortoise and Eastern box turtle live in the southern United States, while the alligator snapping turtle lives in the Gulf Coast. The saltwater terrapin lives in brackish coastal estuaries and marshes from Cape Cod to Padre Island.</p>
            <br>
            <p>South Asian turtles have a broad range of species and preferred habitats, ranging from desert to rainforest and from shallow tropical seas to frigid mountain forest. Softshell turtles (family Trionychidae) have their greatest diversity in Asia and occur in most waters, from tiny ponds to large rivers. The Asian pond or river turtles (family Geoemydidae) show more diversity than their North American relatives. The Asian box turtles (genus Cuora) tend to be more aquatic than the American box turtles, spending much of their time in forest ponds and streams. The elongate tortoise (Indotestudo elongata) is found in a variety of open woodland habitats.</p>

            <p>Leatherbacks and other sea turtles migrate hundreds of kilometres from their main feeding areas to nest on the beaches where they hatched. River-dwelling turtles also migrate tens of kilometres to find large sandbars on which to nest. The number of eggs in a single clutch is variable between species and increases with body size. 
            Eggs are laid....
            <!-- unordered list -->

                <li>Anually</li>

             Turtle eggshells can be leathery or brittle, and calcium carbonate is a constituent of both.</p>
            <p>Nest digging is a fixed behavioral pattern in most turtles, where the female digs chambers with alternate scooping movements of the hind limbs. After reaching a depth equal to the length of her outstretched hind limbs, she drops her eggs into the hole and drags the loose soil back into the nest. Some species dig a shallow nest with both fore- and hind feet.</p>

            <p>Temperature-dependent development in turtle eggs is variable, with incubation time ranging from 45 to 75 days. Some species have embryonic diapause, which can be as long as 12 months. Sex determination is determined by temperature, with the critical period being during the second trimester of incubation. Increases in air and sea surface temperatures have had significant effects on sex ratios. The sex ratio of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) juveniles and subadults from the northern parts of Australia's Great Barrier Reef became overwhelmingly female between 1960 and 2016 due to air temperatures rising.</p><br>
            <p>Hatchlings have a caruncle on the tip of the snout, which is pushed against the inner surface of the eggshell and tears a larger opening. Upon reaching the surface, hatchlings move to the water or into leaf litter or dense vegetation to avoid predators.</p>
