            <p>Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the waters, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. But in recent times, as human populations have grown quickly, new, intense pressures have emerged, making it harder than ever for sea turtles to survive.</p>

            <h1>Habitat Loss and Degradation</h1>

            </figure>
            <p id="intro"> Destruction and alteration of nesting beaches and feeding grounds pose a severe threat to turtle populations. Coastal development, erosion, pollution, and climate change contribute to the loss and degradation of critical habitats. As nesting areas diminish and feeding grounds become polluted or inaccessible, turtles face challenges in finding suitable habitats for reproduction and foraging 
            </p>
            <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Habitat loss and degradation can disrupt nesting sites and feeding grounds, leading to a decline in turtle populations</li>
                <li>Turtles may struggle to find suitable areas to lay their eggs</li>
                <li>the loss of feeding habitats can result in malnutrition and reduced reproductive success.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to prevent...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Protecting and restoring coastal habitats</li>
                <li>implementing strict coastal development regulations</li>
                <li>promoting sustainable land use practices are essential in preventing habitat loss</li>
                <li>Creating marine protected areas and implementing habitat restoration initiatives can also help maintain crucial nesting and foraging habitats</li>

            </figure>
            <p id="intro">Turtles are illegally hunted and poached for their meat, eggs, shells, and other body parts. These items are in demand for traditional medicines, food, and the exotic pet trade. Poaching disrupts natural breeding cycles and reduces turtle populations. It also undermines conservation efforts and sustainable management practices that aim to protect these vulnerable species. </p>
          
            <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Illegal poaching and the wildlife trade pose a grave threat to turtle populations</li>
                <li>The killing of turtles for their meat, eggs, shells, and other products disrupts breeding cycles and leads to population decline</li>
                <li>the trade in live turtles for the exotic pet market contributes to the illegal wildlife trade</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to prevent...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong enforcement of laws against poaching and wildlife trafficking is crucial</li>
                <li> Public awareness campaigns, education programs, and community engagement initiatives can help curb the demand for turtle products</li>
                <li>Supporting sustainable livelihood alternatives for local communities</li>
                <li>promoting responsible tourism</li>

            <p id="intro">Turtles often become unintentionally caught in fishing nets, lines, and traps intended for other marine species. This phenomenon, known as bycatch, is a significant threat to turtles, particularly in areas where fishing activity is high. Turtles can drown or suffer injuries from entanglement, impacting their survival rates and contributing to population decline.</p>
           
            <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Turtles often become unintentionally caught in fishing gear, resulting in injury or death</li>
                <li> Bycatch can lead to population declines, particularly for critically endangered species</li>
                <li>It disrupts marine ecosystems and affects the overall health and biodiversity of the ocean</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to prevent...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing turtle-friendly fishing practices, such as the use of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in fishing nets</li>
                <li>Promoting responsible fishing practices, training fishermen on proper handling techniques</li>
                <li>supporting sustainable fisheries management</li>
